These programs solve the 3NAESAT problem and the 3-Color problem using backtracking. 

- find3NAESAT - Given a file of 3CNF clauses, solves the 3NAESAT problem on each one.
- find3Color - Given a file of graphs, solves the 3-Color problem on each one.
- find3NAESAT3Color - Given a file of 3CNF causes, reduces the clauses to a graph and then uses the 3-color solve to solve the 3NAESAT problem

Compile with javac *.java, and then run each file like so:
